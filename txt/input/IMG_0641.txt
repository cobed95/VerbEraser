Namjun: Grandma, are you enjoying Bongpyeong festival? 
Grandma: Oh, yes. The fields of white flowers are beautiful. Yi Hyoseok's book seems to come alive. Namjun: Yes, it does. Grandma, let's go over to the waterside village. We can walk on stones, wooden bridges and dip our hands in water. 
Grandma: Waterside village was a wonderful experience, but wait to try different kinds of buckwheat dishes.
Namjun: Me, too. Let's head over there now. 
Grandma: That was a really good lunch. Is it time for performances, dear? 
Namjun: Yes, they're singing Pyeongchang Arirang. 
Grandma: Oh, I really like Pyeongchang Arirang.
Namiun: If you don't mind my asking, what is the difference between Pyeongchang Arirang and Arirang?
Grandma: Pyeongchang Arirang is sung by Farme while working in the fields, but Arirang is a kind of sad folk song. 
Namjun: I see. Grandma, look! Paper lanterns! Aren't they beautiful over the field of buckwheat flowers?
Grandma: Yes, they are. Next year, we should come with your mom and dad. 
Namjun: Yes. Let's make sure we do that.
