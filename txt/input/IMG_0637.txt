A: Have you seen this photo? It's one of the most famous portraits ever made. 
B: Oh, that is Winston Churchill, isn't it? 
A: Yes. This photo, taken by Yousuf Karsh, a famous portrait photograper, was on the cover of LIFE magazine when World War II ended. 
B: I see. Is there an interesting story behind it? 
A: Yes. As the story goes, Churchill was angry that he had not been told he was to be photographed. And on top of that, he lit a fresh cigar and puffed. The photographer asked him to take the cigar from his mouth, but he refused. The photographer then took the cigar out of his mouth and took the picture. 
B: Oh, that's how the photographer took the determined look on Churchill's face. It's always a pleasure to hear the back story.
