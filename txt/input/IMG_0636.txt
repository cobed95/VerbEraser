Yuri: Chris, thanks for the I Love New York logo
IONY T-shirt. I've always wanted one. 
Chris: You're welcome. See this bag. I'm a fan of this logo. 
Yuri: Me, too. The shape of this logo is simple and appealing. 
Chris: Yes, and the font of I Love New York logo is casual. It doesn't have confusing letters. Did you know that this logo was initially used to attract tourists? 
Yuri: Really? I thought everyone wanted to visit New York. 
Chris: Not so. As the story goes, people thought New York was dirty and high priced. However, the logo represented peace and showed a friendly image
of the city. 
Yuri: Well, I love the logo and I love your bag. Can I see the bag? 
Chris: Sure. 
Yuri: It's lovely. For my birthday, there is something I want. Hint, hint! 
Chris: Okay, I got your hint. Now, can I have my bag back?
