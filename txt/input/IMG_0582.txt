W Thank God, it's Friday. 
M Yeah, it was a tough week for both of us. 
W I couldn't agree more. Every day was busy. 
M Hey, why don't we go out for some fun? We deserve it. 
W I guess you're right. Let's see a movie tonight. 
M Sounds great. What time should we meet? 
W How about 7 pm? 
M Can you move it back one hour? I need to pick up my brother. 
W No problem. Meet me in front of the box office, OK? 
M You mean at the movie theater we usually go to: 
W Yes. See you there.
