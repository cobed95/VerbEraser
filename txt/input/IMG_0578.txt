W Mr. Potter, come in. 
M Hi.
W So, how's the pain? Does it still hurt? 
M Yes, very much. Do I have cavities or something? 
W Well, yes. I think your wisdom tooth will need to come out.
M Will that be expensive?
W It depends. You have dental insurance, don't you? 
M No, I don't. 
W In that case, it will be fairly expensive. 
M I see. If it needs to be pulled out, there's no reason to wait. 
W OK. Let's get it out right away.
