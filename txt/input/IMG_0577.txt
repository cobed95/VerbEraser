W What can we do about the generation gap? People, young or old, constantly talk about this problem. Teenagers complain that their parents don't understand them. But they don't do the simplest thing to close the gap: talk. I think the best way to bring the generations closer together is to talk. I strongly advise you to spend some time every day chatting with your parents. Then you'll be able to better understand them, and they'll be able to better understand you. If you have a quick chat with your parents on a regular basis, chances are that all of you will understand one another much better.
