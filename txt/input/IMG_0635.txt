Ms. Hill: Bora, thanks for taking time · Bora, thanks for taking time out to show me around Seoul. 
Bora: It's my pleasure. Ah, so, this is Gwanghwamun
Plaza. Look! There's the palace gatekeeper's patrol. Ms. Hill: Wow! Awesome! Let me take a picture of them. 
Bora: Sure. Here, come this way. Do you see that
statue over there looking up with his head turned a little to the side? 
Ms. Hill: Yeah, I see it. It looks like a lion What is it?
Bora: It's called “Haechi." He is a mythical beast that can recognize good and evil. The city wants to use it to represent Seoul in a global marketing program, like the Merlion of Singapore and the bear of Berlin. Haechi is Seoul's newly made symbol. 
Ms. Hill: It's like an icon, like New York's 'Big Apple.' Bora: Yes, the Haechi character is used on the City Hall documents and promotional materials - pens, cars, and business cards. 
Ms Hill: Remind me later to get a Haechi character. Now, what's for lunch? 
Bora: Have you had a chance to eat kimchi jjigae and gyeranmari? 
Ms. Hill: No, but I love Korean food, so I'm_betting I will like them.
