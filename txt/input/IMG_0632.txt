A: James, it looks as though you're upset with me. What's wrong? 
B: I thought we were best friends, but I guess I was wrong.
A: Hey, what are you talking about? I've known you since primary school and we've always been good friends.
B: Then how could you say such things about me? I've heard other kids call me those funny names, but I never thought I would hear that from you. 
A: Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hurt your feelings. It was a joke. 
B: It's important that you understand what's funny to you may not be funny to others.
A: I'm sorry for what I said. It was very considerate. 
B: Since you really are sorry, I'll accept your apology. 
A: Thank you, James. I'll never say those things again. I promise.
