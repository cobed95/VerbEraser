M Yes, what is it?
W I've been walking around the festival for an hour looking for my son. 
M Where did you see him last?
W I saw him by the food stand. He was eating a hot dog. 
M OK. What does he look like?
W He's ten years old and skinny with curly black hair. 
M What's he wearing?
W He's wearing jeans and a striped T-shirt. And he's walking his dog.
M OK, I’ll keep an eye out for him.

M Hi, I'm so glad you're open. I got a flat.
W Did you drive here?
M Yes. I drove slowly in from the highway. Do you fix tires here?
W Well, normally, yes, but our mechanic is off today.
M Oh, no.
W He can fix it tomorrow if you can leave it.
M I guess I have no choice. I can't drive it like this. 
W Well, you can leave the keys with me, and the mechanic will fix it first thing in the morning.
M In that case, I'll have to call home to have someone pick me up. Could I use a phone? My battery is dead.
W Sure. You can use this one.

M Are you ready to go to dinner? 
W Yes. I'm starving! 
M Well, how about that Italian place over there? 
W Actually, I've heard it's kind of expensive. 
M All right. How about that new restaurant across the street?
W I'd like to eat there, but look how long the line is! 
M That's no problem. The place behind us has good food. 
W Yes, it is good, but the restaurant staff is rude. 
M Well, I only have one idea left. 
W What's that? 
M We could just go home and cook something there. 
W That sounds like a great idea. Let's go.

W Good morning, sir. How can I help you? 
M Hi. I was wondering if I could rent a car. 
W You didn't make a reservation? 
M No. I didn't have time. I'm visiting on such short notice. 
W Well, you've come to the right place. Um, we have a blue Ford Escort available for just $75 a day. 
M Did you say $75 for a Ford Escort? 
W Right. But, we also have bigger cars. You can get a Lincoln Continental for $140 a day. 
M Oh, I can't afford that. I'll go for the Ford. What other expenses thould I expect? 
W Um, $30 per day for full insurance and unlimited mileage. 
M OK. I need to be on the safe side. I'll take the insurance package.
