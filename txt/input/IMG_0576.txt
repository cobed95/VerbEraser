W Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. We're slowing down to a complete stop. We were told that a train has 28 broken down-in front of us, so we can't proceed. But they've told us they're working on it right now. I expect we shouldn't be here for too long. We're very sorry for chape the delay. Once again, we're stopping briefly because a train ahead of us has broken down. For your own safety, please don't leave the train until we get the green light. Thank you.
