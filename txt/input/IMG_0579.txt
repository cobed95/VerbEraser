M Hey, can you grab me two onions? 
W Here you go. Anything else I can do for you? 
M Sure. See the three carrots over there? Can you cut them up? 
W No problem. What are you making, by the way? 
M A winter soup. But I still have to add more ingredients. 
W Like what? These apples? 
M No, the three apples are for a special tea. 
W I see. So, are you going to add all these other things? 
M Yep. The garlic, peppers, beef, and potatoes. 
W Wow, this looks like it will be great.
