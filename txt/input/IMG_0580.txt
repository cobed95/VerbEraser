M Almost done? 
W No, I'm stuck! I don't know where to go from here. 
M Well, have you started editing it yet? 
W No. I have the video and audio all recorded and
uploaded, but.
M How long is the entire video? 
W Right now? About ten minutes. 
M That's way too long for a news broadcast. That's what the assignment is, right? 
W Yes. We have to make a 3- to 5-minute-long video report about a problem in our town. 
M OK, so would you like some help with the editing? 
W Yes, please. You took this class last year, didn't you? M Yeah. We had the same assignment. I'll help you finish it.
