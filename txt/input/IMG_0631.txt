Mr. Davis: Okay. What are you two upset about? 
Mark: Well, Mr. Davis, a minute ago, Joyce took my bag and threw it over there spilling everything on the floor. 
Joyce: Someone, I won't say who, told me Mark said I'm a bully. And he spread a rumor that I broke up a friendship by sending anonymous text messages None of that is true. 
Mr. Davis: I see. Joyce, it doesn't matter what Mark may have said about you. Becoming violent is no way to resolve your disagreement.
Joyce: I'm sorry, Mr. Davis, but I felt like he had put me down.
Mark: But I never said those things about you. They are all misunderstandings.
Mr. Davis: Now, it's important that you agree to work together to resolve your differences without blaming or shouting. What do you say? 
Mark, Joyce: Okay, we agree, but how do we go about that? 
Mr. Davis: First, each of you explains the conflict from your view. The other person just listens and keeps quiet. When that person finishes, you can ask questions. Most of all, the key to resolving the conflict is
recognizing the other person's need to feel respected.
Mark, Joyce: Thank you, Mr. Davis. We'll give it a try.
