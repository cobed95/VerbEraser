Bora: Hey, Kate. Your pen looks just like mine
Kate: Oh, that's because it's your pen, Bora. I
it from you ten minutes ago. 
Bora: Borrowed? I don't remember lending it to you. Did you take it without my permission?
Kate: Oh, come on. We're friends. Friends don’t have to ask. I believe you know what I want, think, or need, right? 
Bora: You know what? Borrowing without asking is stealing. 
Kate: Hey, you're being too sensitive about this. 
Bora: This is not the first time you've "borrowed” my stuff without asking. Yesterday you were flipping through my science magazine without my
permission, and the other day, you wore my shoes without my permission. 
Kate: I did. I don't mind you using my things without asking since we are friends. I thought you would feel the same way.
Bora: It's not about friendship, Kate. Even though we're good friends, it's important that we be courteous and mind our manners to each other. 
Kate: Sorry, I didn't think of it that way. I will keep what you said in mind. Are we still friends? 
Bora: Of course.
