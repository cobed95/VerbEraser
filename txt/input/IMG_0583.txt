M Hello, listeners. Are you environment-friendly? Do you care about the environment? If you say yes, here's a opportunity to prove that you really mean it. The annual beach cleanup is coming up. It will be on December 12. That's two days from today. The cleanup will start at 10 in the morning. Please help keep the beach clean. The organizers are looking for volunteers to help clean up the beach on December 12. Please be sure to bring appropriate clothing for the event as it is expected to get quite cold and wet. You don't have to bring a lunch, though. Sandwiches and hot drinks will be provided to all volunteers. For further information about the cleanup effort, please visit our website at www.beachcleanup.org.
