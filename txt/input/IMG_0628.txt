Namjun: Ms. Jones, do you have time to talk to me? Ms. Jones: Sure. What can I do for you?
Namjun: James is my best friend, but we are not on speaking terms. 
Ms. Jones: I'm sorry to hear that. What happened?
Namjun: He wears braces and I called him “Metal Mouth." 
Ms. Jones: That wasn't very thoughtful of you. Most young people are very sensitive about their looks.
Namjun: Thinking back, I regret having said that. 
Ms. Jones It looks as though you really want to remain his friend. Why not apologize? 
Namjun: That's a good idea. I'll even bring him his favorite fruit smoothie.
