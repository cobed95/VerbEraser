Kate: Hey, why did you choose Neil Armstrong as your role model?
Namjun: An image of my future self is a picture of me on the moon. And on top of that, I chose Neil as my English name. 
Kate: You really are a fan of Neil Armstrong. My grandfather told me that he sat glued to the television watching Apollo 11 land on the moon.
Namjun: I know everything about the Apollo 11 space mission.
Kate: Really? What did they use to activate the ascent engines? 
Namjun: That's easy. As the story goes, Aldrin broke the switch, so they used a ball-point pen. Can you tell me Neil Armstrong's famous words? 
Kate: Of course. “That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.” 
Namjun: I will always keep those words in my heart.
