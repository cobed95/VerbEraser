Jimin: Mr. Davis, I'm glad you came with us to help gather chestnuts. 
Mr. Davis: I wouldn't have missed it for the world. Okay, who has a chestnut story.
Jimin: I do. I read that 2500 years ago chestnuts
were taken from Asia via Greece to the West. 
Taewan: I learned that chestnuts are healthy for you and became an important food, just like corn and potatoes in other parts of the world. 
Jimin: Mr. Davis, tell us. I can't wait to hear your story. 
Mr. Davis: Well, do you see this white linen bag? 
Taewan: Yes, but if you won't mind my asking what does that have to do with chestnuts? 
Mr. Davis: I grew up in the United States, but my mom grew up in Italy. Every fall my sister and I experienced a taste of Italy when a package from my grandmother arrived. It contained a white linen bag filled with dried smoked chestnuts, which we ate like hard candy. 
Jimin: What a nice memory of your childhood! 
Mr. Davis: Wouldn’t it be nice if we could all go back to childhood? 
Taewan: Mr. Davis, what are you talking about? We are still in our childhood. 
Mr. Davis: Ha, ha. That's true!
