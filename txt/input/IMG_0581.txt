W Do you cook often? 
M Actually, I don't like to cook, so I eat out a lot. I love to try new restaurants. 
W Oh, really? Well, how do you find good restaurants? 
M Well, some people read restaurant reviews in newspapers
or magazines, but I don't do that. I usually find places by word of mouth. I ask my friends or people at work for
suggestions. That's how I found my favorite restaurant. 
W Oh? What's it called? 
M The Fish World. Maybe you know it. It's on Chestnut
Street. 
W I think I know that one. 
M It has excellent food. Would you like to come with me
sometime soon? 
W Isn't the food there very expensive? 
M A little bit, but you'll love their fish. 
W OK. Why not?
