M Hi James. I'm Namjun. How's it going? Are you still angry at me? I've known you for six years. We went to the same primary school and middle school, and now, high school. I can't think of my school life without you. You've always been special to me, and I'm sure we'll be best friends, even after we graduate from high school. 
I know what I said to you was very inconsiderate and it must have hurt your feelings. I meant it only as a joke, not to hurt you. In my class, I heard those funny names like “Ironman," and "Metal Mouth." I laughed a lot with my friends. I thought you would laugh with me, once you heard those names, just as much as I did. I realized that what's funny to some may not be to others. I'm so sorry about my inconsiderate joke, and I will never say those things again. Please accept my apology and know that your friendship means a lot to me.
