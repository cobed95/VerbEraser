M Frank's Furniture Shop is going out of business! That's right, everything must go! Hurry into one of our local stores today to get the deal of your life. Buy a new living room sofa or chair at half price. Come look at our discounted kitchen appliances - we have everything from refrigerators and microwaves to ovens and dishwashers. Do you need a new carpet? How about a nice lamp? We have those, too! Twenty-five, 50, even 75% off! But you'd better hurry. Things are disappearing fast! We'll be open all weekend, just for you. Doors open at 7 am on Saturday and Sunday and they won't close until midnight! Come on by and get a great deal. You'll save big! But remember, this crazy event ends this weekend!
