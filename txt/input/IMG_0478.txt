M Yes? 
W It's Linda's birthday this Saturday. 
M I know. I have to buy something for her. Did you get anything yet? 
W Not yet. Well, I want to buy her a DVD as a present. 
M That's a good idea. She loves movies.
W Well, the problem is I have no money at the moment. Can I borrow some from you?

W Sure. 
M We can go shopping together then. 
W Good idea. You can help me buy the DVD. 
M OK. You can help me buy the present, too.
